# MKebsi's Website
This project is made as a personal portfolio for myself and every excited designer. You can freely use this project for any purpose, but please don't: 
- Take it as it is and sell it, or
- Use the logos within this project as yours

## Installation
This project used CSS and Javascript, so just clone the project to your hard disk, and that is it.
> Note: You may use a localhost for the univeral linking - `href` or `src` elements that start with `/` to locate something from the root. Also the other projects have their own repo at [my github account](https://github.com/alkebsi)

## Technologies & Styles Used
- Grid Layouts
- JS Animation using Anime.js
- One CSS Coloring File (Easily Changeable)
- Forced dynamics (such as the email form)
- Only Javascript, CSS3 and HTML5
- No React, Node.js, jQuary, Bootstrap...etc
- No PHP, ASP, SQL...etc. Only static website

## Contributions
Please, this is a very personal website, so if you are willing to help me, I would be really glad. First of all, not to let you work hard hours for me and, at the end, I reject your pull request, contact me first and then we will discuss your ideas. Thanks for everyone who would spend even a minute fixing anything that was done wrong or adding initiative ideas. Contributions are appreciated by all means.
